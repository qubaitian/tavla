## tavla - we talk in lojban

### what is "tavla"

"tavla" means "talk" in lojban, we talk to each other and machines in lojban, what i want is a uniform communicating model,
we use this program to speak lojban with machines

### why is "tavla"
I am fed up with the gap between languages include human languages like english or chinese which has natural weakness and
program language and domain-specific language, i just want to talk to others no matter people or machine

### why is "lojban"
Consistency between spoken and written language, consistency between form and meaning, and cultural neutrality. lojban has
many fascinating features, and the most important feature is lojban is a constructed language, we can parse it. i dont mind
use other language, as long as the language has more fantastic features, anyway we hava a language to start

### why is "common lisp"
what i have to say is i even cant write common lisp well too, but as same as the reason i choose lojban, i have a program language
to start up with, and common lisp has many fascinating features too

### discussion
- Discord Server : https://discord.gg/qUy9ZtdC

all discussion is welcome and criticism is more welcome, because i even dont know this project is practicable or not, please
tell me all you think, i am grateful to know

### next step

i will learn lojban the language we talk and common lisp the language i use and other programs and their api so we can use them
and even english because all the things are based on it, and when i learn something new, i can put into this project, which is
the only good thing up to now, ok lets go
